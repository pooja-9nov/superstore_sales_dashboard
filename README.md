# Superstore_Sales_Dashboard (Tableau)
## Superstore sales performance dashboard (2014-2017)
This project explores sales performance across product sub-categories and regions using Tableau. The dashboard provides insights into revenue distribution, regional trends, and profitability, helping stakeholders identify growth opportunities and areas of concern.

## Tools Used
- Tableau Public – for data visualization and dashboard building
- Microsoft Excel ([`Sample - Superstore`](https://github.com/pooja-9nov/superstore_sales_dashboard/blob/main/sample_-_superstore.xls) – as the primary data source
- GitHub – for portfolio hosting and version control

## Key Insights
- Phones, Chairs, and Storage are the top-selling sub-categories by volume.
- California and New York contribute the highest sales revenue.
- Some states show high sales but negative profit margins, indicating cost inefficiencies.
